## Notes for Revision:

Great README and Diary.  I appreciate seeing your journey through the work. I realy enjoyed how much personality your little sprite had!  This shows considerable improvement over just a few weeks ago.  I'm impressed!  Keep up the good work!  No revision needed - but a more elegant end-game mode would be nice.
