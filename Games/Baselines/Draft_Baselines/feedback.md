## HW1 - travel time

* functions should (almost) never print, they should simply return.
* you should include testing code in your py file.  I'll teach how

## HW2 - guessing game

You're using two back-to-back `if` statements where you should be using `if/elif/else`.

I'm not sure what the `imp` module you're importing is.

## Night Sky

On one hand, this is your first python program at Union.  On the other hand, it's not great:

* you say "blatantly stolen" code, but don't give credit.  stolen from where?
* you draw stars outside of the Game Loop, thereby violating the Sanctity Of The Loop

## Overall Feedback

This is a good start, but you've got a lot of fundamental clean coding skills to develop
