# Baselines Dev Diary

## Completed Assignment Requirements:
### hw1_1
* Define a function `star_travel_time` that takes two arguments: a) Distance to a star in light years. b) Percentage of the speed of light a ship travels
* The function should return time till the ship reaches the star
* Provide instructions/examples in a comment
### hw1_2
* Write a program that randomly picks a secret number and lets the player guess the number
    * Player gets infinite tries
    * Player told whether guess was too high or low
    * Define a function that starts the game
### nightsky
* Write pygame script that draws a starry nightsky
    * Stars:
        * Small circles w/ random radii: 1 to 4 pixels
        * Placed randomly around screen

## Implemented Optional Features:
### nightsky
* Shooting star:
    * Moves across sky
    * Disappears
    * Reappears in random location
    * Vary in size

## Personal Optional Features:
### nightsky
* Shooting star:
    * Shrink to nothing as it approaches dissapearing
    * Slows to stop as it approaches dissapearing
    * Randomized starting speed

## New Features Learned:
### hw1_1
* Python
* Importing methods 
### nightsky
* pygame

## Old knowledge dusted off:
### hw1_1
* coding

## Easiest/Most fun:
* Most aspects of this assignment were relatively easy.

## Struggles:
### nightsky
* Making the shooting star took a lot of effort, but that's mainly because of all the bonus I did.
