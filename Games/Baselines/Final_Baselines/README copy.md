## Description:
My first out-of-class assignment for CSC 245! This folder contains 3 independent python files that all do different things:


## hw1_1.py
File with a method that takes two arguments (distance to a star in light years and % of the speed of light a ship travels) and returns the time till the ship reaches the star.

### Requirements:
Python must be installed.

### Instructions:
The file has test cases commented out at the bottom. Uncommenting them and running the file will test the method.


## hw1_2.py
File with a program that randomly picks a secret number and lets the player guess the number.

### Requirements:
Python must be installed.

### Instructions:
Running the python file will start the game.


## nightsky.py
File with a program that draws a starry nightsky. The sky has randomly placed and sized stars represented by circles and a shooting star appears every so often.

### Requirements:
Pygame must be installed.

### Instructions:
Running the python file will draw the nightsky in a new window.
