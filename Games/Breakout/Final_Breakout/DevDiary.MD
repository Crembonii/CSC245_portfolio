# Break Out Dev Diary
## Assignment Requirements:
* Player controlled paddle
* A bouncing ball
* Destructible blocks
* A score keeping mechanism
* Object-oriented implementation
* A README.md with a description of the game.
* A GameDev Diary (this document)
## Implemented Optional Features:
* Splash and Game Over screens
## Unimplemented Optional Features:
* Power ups / Negative effects
* Multiple balls
* Multiple game modes
* Additional paddles
* More advanced physics / collisions
* Art assets / animation
* Sound effects / music
## Personal Optional Features:
* Having everything scale with window sizes so changing the window doesn't break the game.
* Win and lose screens that show the player their score.
* Making a system to make all the bricks with only a number of rows and columns
## New knowledge learned
* How to display text on screen in pygame.
* How to create many varying objects with while and if statements (initializing the bricks.)
* How to make an eventMap.
* Godforsaken vector math.
* Importing classes from one file to another (in python.)
## Old knowledge dusted off:
* General object oriented programing.
* Excessive commenting.
* Creating object initialization functions.
## Easiest/Most fun:
* While statement to make brick objects.
    * Scaling brick size with window size.
    * Scaling brick size with # of collomns.
* Making the win screen and having it appear
* Making the text of the win/lose screen scale with the window size.
## Struggles:
* Implementing Ball Vs AABB collision, and the eventMap (both of which I
gave up on by request of John. (and both of which I did anyways because
I am clinically insane.))
* Finishing on time.
* ~~Dealing with the regret of having not written this in Markdown.~~
## Work done post submition:
* Re-working this DevDiary and the README into Markdown.
* Making all but one revision (see feedback_of_feedback.mb)
* Removed "My process" section of DevDiary (Too many words, not enough value.)
