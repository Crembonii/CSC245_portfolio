# Starter Portfolio

This file is a very simple template to help you craft your portfolio for CSC245.  A reminder that your portfolio exists as **proof** that you met your grading contract (at a chosen grade).   Having your material well organized with accompanying narrative elements is an important part of that process.

## Manifest

This `README.md` at the top level of your repo should exist as a table of contents of sorts, guiding the reader through your portfolio.  Your code and other contributions should then exist in well organized subdirectories, each with their own markdown-formatted files.

* [Contract](Contract/README.md) - my contract and kwl
* [Games](Games/README.md) - games developed for this class
* [In-Class](In-Class/README.md)
* [Other](Other/README.md)
