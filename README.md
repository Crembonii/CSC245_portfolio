# Nolan A. Kelley CSC 245 Portfolio

This file is a very simple template to help you craft your portfolio for CSC245.  A reminder that your portfolio exists as **proof** that you met your grading contract (at a chosen grade).   Having your material well organized with accompanying narrative elements is an important part of that process.

## Manifest

This `README.md` at the top level of your repo should exist as a table of contents of sorts, guiding the reader through your portfolio.  Your code and other contributions should then exist in well organized subdirectories, each with their own markdown-formatted files.
